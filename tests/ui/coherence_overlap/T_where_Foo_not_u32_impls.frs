// Test positive impl that has a where-clause which checks for itself,
// i.e., `T: Foo where T: Foo`. This `T: Foo` where-clause isn't harmful
// in the coinductive interpretation of trait matching, it actually
// doesn't change the meaning of the impl at all. However, this formulation
// was erroneously accepted by an earlier variant of negative impls.
